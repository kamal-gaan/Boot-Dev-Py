# The Archer class should inherit from Hero. Ensure the following requirements from the game designers are completed:

# Archer should inherit from Hero
# Archer should set up the hero's name and health
# Set a private "number of arrows" variable that can be passed in as a third parameter to the constructor.
# Create a shoot method that takes a target hero as input. 
# If there are no arrows left, raise a not enough arrows exception. 
# Otherwise, remove an arrow and deal 10 damage to the target hero.

    def __init__(self, name, health):
